## About Me

Hi! I am Tao Sun, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stony Brook University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Haibin Ling</a>.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in machine learning and computer vision, particularly domain adaptation, transfer learning, weakly-supervised learning. I also work on adversarial attack and defense of neural networks. My past research includes ensemble learning, recommender system, and medical image processing.
